Using this method is NOT recommended. It is better to use code blocks. This method is very limited and does not support all the features of the code block method.

## ‚ùì Why use this method

This method is useful when you want to make a quick request or you need to reuse the same request multiple times. You just need to fill the fields, press `Ctrl+P`, search for `APIR` and select the way you want to display the response (Show a modal or paste it into the document). 

Another advantage is that you can save the request and assign a `shortcut` to it. This way you can make the request just by pressing the keys you assigned.
